# AI Painting Agent using Deep Reinforcement Learning

Training an artificial intelligence Painting Agent that can paint strokes on a canvas in sequence to generate a painting that resembles a given image (target image) 

The notebooks contain demonstrations of the how to generate images using Deep Reinforcement Learning using neural renderers and deep deterministic policy gradient
